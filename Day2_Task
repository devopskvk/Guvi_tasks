1. Create a file with .txt extension (/home/demo.txt). Change the permission set if that file, so that any user can read it, group can read/write & owner can read/write/execute it.


Inside the /home directory only root or sudo users can able to create a file. Here i took root user to create a file.

[root@jenkinsserver home]# touch demo.txt
[root@jenkinsserver home]# getfacl demo.txt 
# file: demo.txt
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
group::r--
other::r--

[root@jenkinsserver home]# ls -la demo.txt 
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Jan 21 16:45 demo.txt

# Option 1
[root@jenkinsserver home]# chmod u+rwx,g+rw,o+r demo.txt

[root@jenkinsserver home]# ls -la demo.txt 
-rwxrw-r--. 1 root root 0 Jan 21 16:45 demo.txt

# Option 2
[root@jenkinsserver home]# chmod 764 demo.txt 

[root@jenkinsserver home]# ls -la demo.txt 
-rwxrw-r--. 1 root root 0 Jan 21 16:45 demo.txt

root@jenkinsserver home]# getfacl /home/demo.txt 
getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
# file: home/demo.txt
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::rw-
other::r--


#except root user , if you want to access the demo.txt file by multiple users from specific group, we need to create a group and adding all those users into that group.

groupadd guviusers

[root@jenkinsserver home]# grep -i guvi /etc/group
guviusers:x:1003:
[root@jenkinsserver home]# usermod -G  guviusers dev
[root@jenkinsserver home]# usermod -G  guviusers devopskvk
[root@jenkinsserver home]# grep -i guvi /etc/group
guviusers:x:1003:dev,devopskvk


#second, changing the group name using `chgrp grpname demo.txt` .
[root@jenkinsserver home]# chgrp guviusers demo.txt

#The above case, those who are in the group they have a access of rw in home/demo.txt.
[root@jenkinsserver home]# ll demo.txt
-rwxrw-r--. 1 root guviusers 0 Jan 21 16:45 demo.txt

[root@jenkinsserver home]# getfacl demo.txt
# file: demo.txt
# owner: root
# group: guviusers
user::rwx
group::rw-
other::r--

user dev from the guviusers groups
[root@jenkinsserver home]# su dev  -> This command will land into the current directory of previous user stayed.
[dev@jenkinsserver home]$ pwd
/home
[dev@jenkinsserver home]$ vi demo.txt
[dev@jenkinsserver home]$ cat demo.txt 
this is test file for guvi task updated by dev user

user devopskvk from the guviusers groups
[devopskvk@jenkinsserver home]$ pwd
/home
[devopskvk@jenkinsserver home]$ vi demo.txt
[devopskvk@jenkinsserver home]$ cat demo.txt
this is test file for guvi task updated by dev user
this is test file for guvi task updated by devopskvk user

user guviuser
[root@jenkinsserver home]# su guviuser
[guviuser@jenkinsserver home]$ cat demo.txt 
this is test file for guvi task updated by dev user
this is test file for guvi task updated by devopskvk user
[guviuser@jenkinsserver home]$ rm -rf demo.txt  -> except read access the user not able to delete the file.
